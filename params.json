Bloom is designed to work best with [catkin](https://github.com/ros/catkin) projects, but can also accommodate other types of projects.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nBloom works by importing your upstream source tree into a git repository, where it is manipulated and used to generate build artifacts for different platforms like Debian and Fedora.\r\n\r\nAfter importing your upstream source tree, the source tree is run through a release pipeline of git branches, each of which gives you the opportunity to patch the upstream source tree for specific platforms, and finally produces platform specific release tags using platform specific generators.\r\n\r\n### What can I release with bloom?\r\n\r\nBloom supports releasing arbitrary software packages, but is optimized for use with [catkin](https://github.com/ros/catkin) projects.\r\n\r\n_Note: For `dry` ROS stacks, you should use the legacy [ros-release](http://www.ros.org/wiki/release) system._\r\n\r\n### How do I install bloom?\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu the recommend method is to use apt::\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install python-bloom\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn other systems you can install bloom via pypi::\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install -U bloom\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: pip will not notify you of updates, so check often if you use pipip\r\n\r\n### How do I use bloom?\r\n\r\nCheckout the [documentation](doc/index.html)."}
